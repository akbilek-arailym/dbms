so we are making a reaserch based on these questions
we took E-codes supplements for our project: there you can find how it is called, is it approved by our kazakhstan engineers-technologists, is it natural or chemical based, is it from animals or plants, for which body part it is harmful and good, and general information which contains detailed products that contains exactly E-codes
